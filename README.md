### Hello there! I am Josh Jang! I am a software engineer. I have a passion for coding and love to problem solve and learning new technologies.

### My Github contains projects made with mostly Javascript, and I am looking to expand my skill set.

### Collaborating with others and engaging in code reviews is something I truly enjoy. Sharing my knowledge with others is also a great passion of mine.
