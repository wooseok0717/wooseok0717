### Hi there! My name is Josh Jang and I'm a software engineer. I really love coding and I'm always excited to solve problems and learn about new technologies.

### On my Github, you can find projects that I made mostly using Javascript. I am willing to learn new languages and frameworks to improve my skill set.

### Collaborating with others and engaging in code reviews is something I truly enjoy. Sharing my knowledge with others is also a great passion of mine.
